Project Title: Online Event Registration and Management System

Project Description:

This project aims to create a web-based platform for managing events, from creation and promotion to registration and attendee tracking.

Key Features:

Event Creation:
Admin can create new events with details like:
Title, Description, Date/Time, Venue, Capacity, Ticket Prices (if applicable)
Image Upload
Category (e.g., Conference, Workshop, Concert)
Event Listing & Search:
Users can browse upcoming events by category, date, or keyword.
Filtering and sorting options for easy navigation.
Event Registration:
Online registration for attendees with:
User registration/login system
Secure payment gateway integration (optional)
Ticket selection and purchase
Attendee Management:
Admin can view a list of registered attendees for each event.
Download attendee data (e.g., CSV) for record-keeping.
Send email notifications/reminders to attendees.
Dashboard:
Admin dashboard with key metrics:
Number of registered users/events
Sales reports (if applicable)
Event attendance statistics
Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For frontend development (user interface).
SQL: For database management (storing event details, user data, registrations).
Backend (Optional):
Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django for server-side logic.
API development for communication between frontend and backend.
Project Structure:

Frontend:
index.html (homepage)
event_list.html
event_details.html
registration.html
user_profile.html
admin_dashboard.html
css/styles.css
js/scripts.js (for interactive elements, form validation)
Backend (if applicable):
server.js (or equivalent)
routes/ (for organizing API endpoints)
models/ (for defining database models)
Database:
event_management.sql (or .db file)
Project Development Steps:

Database Design:
Create SQL tables for:
Users (ID, Name, Email, Password)
Events (ID, Title, Description, Date, Time, Venue, Capacity, Category, Image)
Registrations (ID, UserID, EventID, TicketType, Timestamp)
Frontend Development:
Design and implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interface.
Create forms for event creation, registration, user login/signup.
Implement basic functionality (e.g., form validation, event listing).
Backend Development (if applicable):
Set up server-side environment (Node.js/Express.js or Python/Flask/Django).
Create API endpoints for:
Event CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
User authentication and registration
Registration processing
Integration:
Connect frontend to backend using API calls.
Integrate with database for data storage and retrieval.
Testing:
Thoroughly test all functionalities for bugs and errors.
User acceptance testing (UAT) to get feedback from potential users.
Deployment:
Deploy the application to a web server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Netlify).
Key Considerations:

Security: Implement strong password hashing, secure data handling, and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of users and events.
User Experience (UX): Focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Accessibility: Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.
Note: This is a basic outline. You can expand this project by adding more features, such as:

Social media integration: Share events on social media platforms.
Email notifications: Send automated emails for event reminders, confirmations, etc.
Reporting and analytics: Generate detailed reports on event performance.
Payment gateway integration: Allow users to pay for tickets online.
This project will provide a valuable learning experience in web development, database management, and project management.
